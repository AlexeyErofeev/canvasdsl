# CanvasDSL

Simple lightweight kotlin-dsl based implementation of android vector drawable without xml.

## Key features

* SVG-like primitives
* Supports references to predefined groups 
* Viewport mechanics with relative "viewport points"
* Mutable model, ready for animation
* No compatibility limits - works with minimum android sdk 1
* One dependency: kotlin stdlib, you should use it anyway for kotlin

## Usecases

* Charts
* Determinate progress, charge indicators
* Another simple data visualization 
* Bitmap decoration
* Correctly painted gradient


## Roadmap

1. Deploy binary 
2. Examples
3. Documentation
4. VectorDrawable loader (separate dependency)  
6. Tests
7. Nested drawable 
8. More primitives (?)
9. Interactive elements (click spots)
